# CLAUDE.md

Read this before making changes. It captures project state, intentional decisions, and known non-blocking issues so you don't re-derive context or undo prior work.

## Project overview

- Calendar Plus is an Obsidian plugin: a fork / new plugin based on Liam Cain's Calendar plugin, with integrated periodic note functionality inspired by Periodic Notes.
- Intentionally a **separate** plugin from the original Calendar plugin — both can be installed and enabled simultaneously.
- Plugin id: `calendar-plus`
- User-facing name: `Calendar Plus`
- Current version: `1.7.18` (kept in sync across `manifest.json`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `versions.json`). 1.7.14 replaced `localStorage.getItem("language")` with Obsidian's `getLanguage()` API, bumped the pinned `obsidian` d.ts to v1.8.7, raised `minAppVersion` to `1.8.7`, and added `"1.7.14": "1.8.7"` to `versions.json` — older Obsidian users keep getting 1.7.13 via that compatibility envelope. 1.7.15 was a metadata-only release that updated the plugin description / tagline in `manifest.json` and `package.json` to clarify Calendar Plus is an update of the original Calendar plugin; no runtime change. 1.7.16 was a visual polish + settings release: left-aligned the month/year/quarter header cluster, made the active quarter label accent-text-only (no background/pill under themes like Minimal), reworked weekend column shading to render as a continuous column (including SAT/SUN headers) under default theme, and added a "Shade weekend columns" toggle under Calendar behavior (defaults ON at the time). 1.7.17 was a checker-recovery styling patch: 1.7.16 had introduced ~24 `!important` declarations in `styles.css` to force uniform weekend rendering under themes like Minimal, which dropped the Obsidian community-plugin checker score from ~99% to 74%. 1.7.17 removed all of those overrides, kept the simple `.weekend-shading-enabled`-gated tint on `th.weekend` / `td.weekend`, and intentionally stopped chasing Minimal-specific weekend-cell uniformity — themes where weekend shading conflicts with the theme's day-cell styling are handled by the user toggling **Shade weekend columns** off, not by additional CSS. 1.7.18 added configurable weekend days (`weekendDays: number[]`, default `[0, 6]` for Sun + Sat) and flipped `shadeWeekendColumns` default to `false` so new installs are opt-in; existing users keep whatever they had saved. 1.7.18 also bundled a small UI-internals tidy (dot data-model cleanup, dead-CSS removal, selector clarification) and a settings-page polish pass (Weekend days picker conditional on the master toggle; "Change week number side" relocated under Weekly Notes; Calendar behavior reordered to Confirm-before-create → Start week on → Shade weekend columns → Ctrl + Click Behavior; user-facing strings standardized to American English). The active-quarter accent-text-only treatment from 1.7.16 is preserved. `minAppVersion` unchanged at 1.8.7 across 1.7.15 / 1.7.16 / 1.7.17 / 1.7.18; `versions.json` now also maps `"1.7.18": "1.8.7"`.
- **Active branch is `main`.** Calendar Plus 1.7.18 is the current stable local baseline and lives on `main`. Earlier sessions worked on a `merge-periodic-notes` branch that has since been promoted to `main` — that name is no longer the working branch. If a branch named `old-main` exists, treat it as archival/reference only (the pre-merge upstream state); do not commit to it or use it as a base for new work.
- **Active repo path on this machine:** `/Users/matt/Desktop/obsidian-plugin-merge/calendar-plus/`. The folder was renamed from `calendar/` to `calendar-plus/` after the 1.7.16 release; if any future doc, script, or memory still references the old `calendar/` path, treat it as stale. `original-calendar/` and `periodic-notes/` (sibling directories at the parent level) are read-only reference material — do not edit them or stage changes from them.

## Important product decisions

- **No backwards compatibility.** Do not write migration code, fallbacks, or compatibility shims for: the original Calendar plugin, the Periodic Notes plugin, Obsidian core Daily Notes settings, or any old data shape. Calendar Plus assumes a clean-slate settings model.
- Calendar Plus owns daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly periodic-note settings directly. It does **not** read from Obsidian's core Daily Notes plugin or the Periodic Notes plugin.
- Dots have exactly one meaning: a periodic note exists for that day/week. No word-count dots, no task dots, no "Words per dot" setting. Don't reintroduce them.
- The plugin must coexist with the original Calendar plugin without collisions (separate view type, separate event namespace, separate manifest id).
- **No `.view-content` padding override.** Calendar Plus intentionally does not target `.workspace-leaf-content[data-type="calendar-plus-view"] .view-content` (or any other `.view-content` selector) for padding, margin, width, or other outer-chrome spacing. The plugin relies on Obsidian's and the active theme's default `.view-content` spacing, matching the original Calendar plugin's baseline. This was investigated and intentionally reverted: a previous attempt to tighten or zero `.view-content` padding produced inconsistent results across themes, leaked spacing into unrelated views, and chased theme-specific renderings (notably Minimal) into a fragile rule. Theme-specific spacing differences should not be addressed by reintroducing a `.view-content` override — any spacing polish should live on internal calendar elements (e.g. `.nav`, `.title-container`, `.quarters`, `.calendar`, `.day`) only.
- **Avoid `!important` in `styles.css`.** The Obsidian community-plugin checker flags every `!important` declaration as a warning ("Avoid !important — override styles by increasing selector specificity or using CSS variables instead"), and accumulating them drops the checker score quickly. 1.7.16 added ~24 `!important`s to force uniform weekend rendering under Minimal; the checker score fell from ~99% to 74%, and 1.7.17 walked all of them back. The standing rule: when a theme conflicts with Calendar Plus styling, prefer (a) modest higher-specificity scoped selectors using the existing `.calendar-plus-wrapper #calendar-container ...` namespace, (b) CSS custom properties (`var(--color-background-day)`, `var(--color-background-weekend)`, etc.) that themes can override cleanly, or (c) a settings toggle that lets users opt out — **do not fight theme internals with `!important`, long view-scoped ancestor chains, or pseudo-element resets**. The **Shade weekend columns** toggle is the canonical example of approach (c): under themes whose `.day` styling makes weekend tinting look busy or inconsistent, the user turns the setting off; Calendar Plus does not try to override the theme.
- **Weekend shading product model (1.7.18).** Two orthogonal settings drive weekend rendering, and they are intentionally kept independent:
  - **Week start** (`weekStart`) — controls **column order only**. Choosing Monday vs Sunday vs Locale default rotates the day-of-week header and the body grid; it does not determine which columns are tinted.
  - **Weekend days** (`weekendDays: number[]`, JS weekday numbers 0 = Sunday … 6 = Saturday) — controls **which columns are tinted** when shading is on. Default `[0, 6]` (Sun + Sat). Independent of locale, week start, or any other setting.
  - **Shade weekend columns** (`shadeWeekendColumns`) — master on/off. Defaults to **off**. Opt-in by design: under themes that paint their own opaque background on day cells, weekend tinting can look busy; the toggle is the user-side remedy and the docs make this clear.
  Do not collapse these into a single setting or infer weekend days from `weekStart`. Do not change the default of `shadeWeekendColumns` back to on. Existing users who saved a `shadeWeekendColumns: true` preference under 1.7.16 / 1.7.17 keep it via the existing `loadOptions` spread merge; only users literally missing the key get the new opt-in default.

## Current architecture

- **Manifest** (`manifest.json`): id `calendar-plus`, name `Calendar Plus`, minAppVersion `0.9.11`. (Current version is in the Project overview above.)
- **Internal namespaces** (`src/constants.ts`):
  - `VIEW_TYPE_CALENDAR = "calendar-plus-view"`
  - `TRIGGER_ON_OPEN = "calendar-plus:open"` (event external plugins listen on to inject sources)
- **Settings** (`src/settings.ts`): `CalendarSettingsTab` extends `PluginSettingTab`. Periodic-note sections are rendered into per-section wrapper divs via `renderPeriodicNoteSection(sectionEl, ...)`, so toggling Enable re-renders only that section (no full-tab rebuild, no scroll jump).
- **Periodic note helpers** (`src/io/periodicNoteHelpers.ts`): pure path/format/parse helpers + vault scan. Includes `getDateFromFilename`, `getPeriodicNotePath`, `applyTemplateTokens`, `getAllPeriodicNotes`, `getDateUID`, `getPeriodicNote`, `ensureParentFolderExists`, `getTemplateInfo`.
- **Shared creation logic** (`src/io/periodicNotes.ts`): `createPeriodicNote(...)` and `tryToCreatePeriodicNote(...)` (handles confirm-before-create modal).
- **Per-period wrapper files** (`src/io/{daily,weekly,monthly,quarterly,yearly}Notes.ts`): each exports a `tryToCreate*Note` that delegates to `tryToCreatePeriodicNote` and handles the open-leaf flow. They exist for naming clarity at call sites.
- **Stores** (`src/ui/stores.ts`): module-level Svelte writables for `settings`, `dailyNotes`, `weeklyNotes`, `monthlyNotes`, `quarterlyNotes`, `yearlyNotes`, `activeFile`. Each per-period store has a `reindex()` method that rescans the configured folder.
- **View / lifecycle** (`src/view.ts`): `CalendarView` extends `ItemView`. Owns the Svelte `Calendar` component, vault file events, settings subscription (registered via `this.register(...)` so it cleans up on view detach), and the periodic-note open/create methods.
- **Plugin registration / commands** (`src/main.ts`): `CalendarPlugin` extends `Plugin`. Registers the view, ribbon icon, and three commands (`show-calendar-view`, `open-weekly-note`, `reveal-active-note`). Commands look up the live view fresh via `getCalendarView()` / `ensureCalendarView()` helpers — no stale `this.view` reference.
- **Calendar UI**: vendored under `src/ui/calendar-ui/` (`components/*.svelte` plus `localization.ts`, `metadata.ts`, `types.ts`, `utils.ts`). Origin: the patched `obsidian-calendar-ui` 0.3.12 source (the patch added quarter navigation, clickable month/year/quarter labels, weekend col classes, and week-num grid borders + active state). The npm dependency and the `patches/obsidian-calendar-ui+0.3.12.patch` file have been removed. `Day.svelte` and `WeekNum.svelte` use the local `getDateUID` from `src/io/periodicNoteHelpers` (with `"daily"` / `"weekly"` periodicity) instead of `obsidian-daily-notes-interface`, which is no longer a transitive dep. Component-internal CSS now lives inside each vendored component's `<style>` block; `styles.css` retains only the wrapper-state-dependent rules (depend on `.daily-enabled`/`.monthly-enabled`/etc. on the outer Calendar Plus wrapper) and the `.calendar-plus-suggest` rule for the document-body-attached settings autocomplete.
- **Autocomplete** (`src/ui/suggest.ts`, `src/ui/file-suggest.ts`): folder/template path autocomplete in settings. No-Popper implementation ported from the Daily Checklist plugin: positioning is `getBoundingClientRect()` + inline `position: fixed`, with capture-true `scroll` and `resize` listeners attached on open and detached on close. Single `TextInputSuggest<T>` class; `FolderSuggest` / `FileSuggest` keep a 2-arg `(app, inputEl)` constructor; `selectSuggestion` still uses `inputEl.trigger("input")` so the existing `Setting.addText(...).onChange(...)` path in `settings.ts` saves on selection. Container carries both `suggestion-container` (Obsidian theme classes) and `calendar-plus-suggest` (namespace hook for `styles.css`).

## Important implementation notes

- **Do not edit bundled `main.js` directly.** Always edit source under `src/` and run `npm run build`. The bundled file is a build artifact.
- **Use npm**, not yarn. The lockfile of record is `package-lock.json`. This repo intentionally does not include `yarn.lock`; do not re-introduce it.
- **Baseline build warnings exist** from `svelte-check` (mappings.wasm fires once per `.svelte` file) and TypeScript reading `node_modules/obsidian/obsidian.d.ts` and `node_modules/@codemirror/view/dist/index.d.ts`. These are pre-existing and unrelated to source changes. Don't chase them unless your edits actually involve those files.
- **Run `git status` before and after changes** so you can confirm the diff matches intent.
- **Keep commits small and focused.** One logical change per commit. Each commit's diff should fit on a screen.
- **Do not run `npm audit fix`.** It can rewrite the lockfile and break the patched dependency setup.
- **Do not commit unless explicitly asked.** Show the diff summary and wait.

## Recent important fixes (1.6.0)

In rough order:

- Removed direct dependency on `obsidian-daily-notes-interface`.
- Consolidated periodic note creation into `src/io/periodicNotes.ts`; per-period files are thin wrappers.
- Added folder/template autocomplete in settings (ported from periodic-notes).
- Fixed `this.calendar.tick is not a function` crash on settings change — root cause was a leaked `settings.subscribe` in `CalendarView` constructor; now wrapped in `this.register(...)` plus a `typeof` guard at the call site.
- Guarded command callbacks (`open-weekly-note`, `reveal-active-note`) against missing or stale `CalendarView` — now look up the live view fresh per invocation; `open-weekly-note` mounts the view if needed, `reveal-active-note` no-ops if absent.
- Initialized `window._bundledLocaleWeekSpec` from settings tab `display()` via `configureGlobalMomentLocale(...)` so the settings tab can render before the calendar view has mounted.
- Deep-merged saved per-period settings on load so a partial `data.json` can't wipe `format`/`folder`/`template` defaults (would have caused `"Invalid date"` filename collisions).
- Settings periodic-note sections re-render only their own wrapper div on toggle (no full-tab rebuild → no scroll jump).
- Added Calendar Plus ribbon icon; clicking reveals the existing leaf or creates one.
- Visual affordance refinements: cursor/hover behavior gated by enabled-class wrappers (`monthly-enabled`, etc.), TODAY/arrow hover opacity, suppressed transient `.day:active` purple flash, weekend column shading via `--color-background-weekend`, week-num font-size matched to day numbers, dot-container reservation to prevent week-num jitter, `localeData` spread to a fresh object so `<svelte:options immutable />` re-renders weekend cols on weekStart change.

## UI internals cleanup (post-1.7.17, uncommitted at time of writing)

A small behavior-preserving polish pass landed after 1.7.17. Items **kept**:

- **Dot data model trim**: dropped the unused `color` field from `IDot`, made `className` optional, removed the unused `isActive` prop from `Dot.svelte` and its unreachable `.active.filled` / `.active.hollow` CSS rules, trimmed the streak-source dot payload to `{ isFilled: true }`.
- **Dead `th { ... }` block removed from `WeekNum.svelte`** (the component renders only `<td>`, so the rule fired on nothing).
- **`.active` selector in `Day.svelte`** rewritten as `.day.active` / `.day.active.today` for clarity. No behavior change — Svelte-scoped CSS already pinned the selector to elements inside Day.svelte.
- **`Nav.svelte` comment rephrase**: removed the only remaining `!important` mention anywhere in `src/`, so grep / checker output stays clean.

Item intentionally **not kept**:

- **Unused helper parameters** (the `..._args: unknown[]` rest params on `getDaysOfWeek`, `getMonth`, `getDailyMetadata`, `getWeeklyMetadata`) were briefly removed in the same pass, but the cleanup was reverted. Removing the params required `(localeData, getMonth(...))` / `(today, getDailyMetadata(...))` comma-operator expressions in `Calendar.svelte` to keep Svelte's reactive-dependency chain intact. The comma-operator pattern is technically correct but less readable and more surprising than passing `localeData` / `today` as ordinary arguments — a reader shouldn't have to recognize the comma-operator idiom to see the reactive deps. The current code keeps the rest-args; `Calendar.svelte` keeps `localeData` / `today` as ordinary call arguments so reactivity is obvious at the call site. A future pass that wants to clean these up should pick a style that doesn't hide reactive deps from readers (e.g. a named `_trigger?: unknown` param is fine, comma operators are not).

## Known baseline / non-blocking issues

These are catalogued in `FUTURE_PLANS.md`. Highlights:

- `styles.css` is intentionally limited to wrapper-state-dependent rules (gated on `.daily-enabled` / `.monthly-enabled` / `.yearly-enabled` / `.quarterly-enabled` classes set on the outer Calendar Plus wrapper) and the `.calendar-plus-suggest` rule for the autocomplete dropdown attached to `document.body`. Component-internal styling already lives inside each vendored Svelte component's `<style>` block.

None of the above blocks shipping.

## Future plans

See `FUTURE_PLANS.md` for full descriptions. Short list:

- **Optional: active-file correctness for monthly / quarterly / yearly (deferred)** — `getDateUIDFromFile` only handles daily / weekly. Nav.svelte doesn't consume `selectedId` for month / year / quarter labels, so M/Q/Y active UIDs would be dead code today. Revisit only if active-file styling for header labels is wanted.
- **Optional: Svelte settings migration (deferred)** — cleaner conditional UI, slide animations. Not planned; the current per-section re-render in `src/settings.ts` works well. Revisit only if the settings UI becomes harder to extend.
- **Optional: Resolve remaining Obsidian plugin warnings (deferred)** — after 1.7.15 (1.7.14 was the last release that touched checker state, replacing `localStorage.getItem("language")` with `getLanguage()` via a d.ts pin bump to 1.8.7) the checker reports zero source-code Errors and a small residual warning set. Two root causes remain: the intentional single `no-restricted-imports` warning on `src/types/moment.ts:2` (the type-only seam that lets the checker resolve `Moment` precisely — only fixable by hand-rolling local Moment interfaces); and Svelte component instance typing on `this.calendar.tick` / `$set` / `$destroy` in `view.ts` (framework-typing noise). Both documented in `FUTURE_PLANS.md`.
- **Accepted: Obsidian checker behavior recommendations** — the checker also flags **Vault Enumeration** as a behavior characteristic (via `Vault.recurseChildren` for note discovery and `vault.getAllLoadedFiles()` for settings autocomplete). Both are required for Calendar Plus's core features (note-existence dots, folder/template autocomplete) and are already scoped when users configure folders. Documented as an accepted architectural trade-off in `FUTURE_PLANS.md` → "Accepted Obsidian checker behavior recommendations". Do not "fix" without revisiting that trade-off.

## Release prep

When the user explicitly asks to bump the plugin version, treat the changelog as part of the same release-prep task unless the user says otherwise. Update these five files together in the same commit:

- `manifest.json` — `version`
- `package.json` — `version`
- `package-lock.json` — both `version` fields (top-level + the root `packages[""]` entry)
- `versions.json` — add `"<new-version>": "<minAppVersion>"`
- `CHANGELOG.md` — add a `## <new-version>` section at the top, summarizing user-facing changes, major refactors, dependency removals, and notable bug fixes since the previous version

Changelog content guidance:
- Lead with what the user will notice. Group related items under short headings if the section is long (see the 1.6.0 entry as a template).
- Mention dependency additions/removals and architectural refactors when they're release-significant, even if user-invisible — future-you will want the context.
- Skip implementation paths and internal symbol names unless they aid debugging.

Proposing version bumps:
- For major user-facing features, major refactors, dependency changes, or other release-significant cleanup, mention in your plan whether a changelog entry and version bump are warranted, and flag the proposed version (major / minor / patch) so the user can confirm.
- For small fixes, do not silently invent a new version number or changelog entry. Ask, or flag the bump as optional if unclear.
- Do not commit the version bump unless the user explicitly asks.

## Suggested workflow for future Claude sessions

1. **Read this file first.** Then read `FUTURE_PLANS.md` if the user's request touches deferred work.
2. **Run `git status`** to see what's already in flight before editing.
3. **Inspect the relevant files** before editing — don't assume they match a memory of an earlier session.
4. **Make one focused change at a time.** Match the scope of the user's request; don't bundle unrelated cleanup.
5. **Run `npm run build`** after each change. Confirm `created main.js` and that any warnings are pre-existing baseline noise (not in your changed files).
6. **Report the diff summary** (`git diff <files>`) and explain what changed and why.
7. **Do not commit** unless the user explicitly asks. Wait for the next instruction.
